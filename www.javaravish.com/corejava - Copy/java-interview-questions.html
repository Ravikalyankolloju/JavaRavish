									compiler builds a default constructor for that class.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>16. What is a static variable?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static

						<h1><b>2. Java Encapsulation Interview Questions</b></h1>
						<br>
						<details>
							<summary>1. What is Encapsulation in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Encapsulation is the main concept of OOPs (Object-Oriented programming).
									Encapsulation means wrapping or binding data and methods in a single unit. It is
									also known as data hiding. Data hiding means it derived the result of a specific
									class. This also means that is not directly accessible. Data in Encapsulation is
									private, the results of the data are called by using different methods. The code is
									wrapped in such a way that it cannot be randomly accessed by other codes outside the
									class.<br>
									Encapsulation Rules:
									<br>
									Always make-instance variable private.<br>
									Always make public accessor methods and force calling code to these methods instead
									of directly calling the instance variable.<br>
									Use naming convention set() and get for these methods.
								</p>

						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>2. How Encapsulation is helpful in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">

								<p>
									In runtime polymorphism, the behavior of a method is decided at runtime, JVM binds

							<summary>11. How is an abstract class related to polymorphism in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Polymorphism in Java allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they
									were of the same type. An abstract class can be used as a base class for creating
									objects of its subclasses, and these objects can be treated as if they were of the
									abstract class type. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where different

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The diamond problem is a situation that arises in multiple inheritance when a

							<summary>23. What is the difference between composition and inheritance?</summary>

									we can use single classes that can be composed within multiple classes and used in
									dependency injection and composition is a relationship between objects, whereas
									Inheritance is a relationship between the classes and it has is a relationship
									between the classes and using inheritance derived class object carries the base
									class definition hence it is a tightly bounded relationship. It is mostly used in
									run time polymorphism, and in this, a single class can only inherit only one class.

									For example if a variable of type Parent holds an object of Child class then method
									invoked will be from child class and not parent class, provides its overridden.

									In order to override a method, you must follow rules of method overriding which

							<summary>21. Advantages of Covariant Return Type?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type.
									But now, since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type
									if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes
									its return type to subclass type<br>
									Following are the advantages of the covariant return type.
									<br>
									1) Covariant return type assists to stay away from the confusing type casts in the
									class hierarchy and makes the code more usable, readable, and maintainable.
									<br>
									2) In the method overriding, the covariant return type provides the liberty to have
									more to the point return types.
									<br>
									3) Covariant return type helps in preventing the run-time ClassCastExceptions on
									returns.

						<details>
							<summary>1. What is an exception in Java, and why is it essential for error handling?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting
									the normal flow. It is essential for handling errors and exceptional conditions
									gracefully.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>2. How many types of exception can occur in a Java program?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is
									considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle, there are three types of
									exceptions:<br>
								<ul class="points">
									<li><strong>Checked Exception:</strong> Checked exceptions are the one which are
										checked at compile-time. For example, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.
									</li><br>
									<li><strong>Unchecked Exception:</strong> Unchecked exceptions are the one which are
										handled at runtime because they can not be checked at compile-time. For example,
										ArithmaticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.
									</li><br>
									<li><strong>Error:</strong> Error cause the program to exit since they are not
										recoverable. For Example, OutOfMemoryError, AssertionError, etc.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>

						<details>
							<summary>3. What is Exception Handling?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Exception Handling is a mechanism that is used to handle runtime errors. It is used
									primarily to handle checked exceptions. Exception handling maintains the normal flow
									of the program. There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked.
									Here, the error is considered as the unchecked exception.</p>

							<summary>4. What is the difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>1) Checked Exception<br>
									The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known
									as checked exceptions, e.g., IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are
									checked at compile-time.
									<br>
									2) Unchecked Exception<br>
									The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions, e.g.,

							<summary>6. Is it necessary that each try block must be followed by a catch block?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>It is not necessary that each try block must be followed by a catch block. It should
									be followed by either a catch block OR a finally block. So whatever exceptions are
									likely to be thrown should be declared in the throws clause of the method.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>7. What is finally block?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program. It is
									executed whether an exception is handled or not. In other words, we can say that
									finally block is the block which is always executed. Finally block follows try or
									catch block. If you don't handle the exception, before terminating the program, JVM
									runs finally block, (if any). The finally block is mainly used to place the cleanup
									code such as closing a file or closing a connection. Here, we must know that for
									each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block.
									The finally block will not be executed if program exits(either by calling
									System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort).</p>

							<summary>8. Can finally block be used without a catch?</summary>

							<summary>14. What are the Exception Handling Keywords in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>There are four keywords used in java exception handling.<br>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>throw</strong>: Sometimes we explicitly want to create an exception
										object and then throw it to halt the normal processing of the program. The
										<strong>throw</strong> keyword is used to throw exceptions to the runtime to
										handle it.
									</li>
									<li><strong>throws</strong>: When we are throwing any checked exception in a method
										and not handling it, then we need to use the throws keyword in the method
										signature to let the caller program know the exceptions that might be thrown by
										the method. The caller method might handle these exceptions or propagate them to
										its caller method using the <code>throws</code> keyword. We can provide multiple
										exceptions in the throws clause and it can be used with the
										<strong>main()</strong> method also.
									</li>
									<li><strong>try-catch</strong>: We use try-catch block for exception handling in our
										code. try is the start of the block and catch is at the end of the try block to
										handle the exceptions. We can have multiple catch blocks with a try and
										try-catch blocks can be nested also. catch block requires a parameter that
										should be of type Exception.</li>
									<li><strong>finally</strong>: The finally block is optional and can be used only
										with a try-catch block. Since exception halts the process of execution, we might
										have some resources open that will not get closed, so we can use the finally
										block. The finally block gets executed always, whether an exception occurs or
										not.</li>

						<details>
							<summary>15. What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>
								<ol>
									<li>Checked Exceptions should be handled in the code using try-catch block or else
										the method should use the throws keyword to let the caller know about the
										checked exceptions that might be thrown from the method. Unchecked Exceptions
										are not required to be handled in the program or to mention them in the throws
										clause of the method.</li>
									<li><code>Exception</code> is the superclass of all checked exceptions whereas
										<code>RuntimeException</code> is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions.
										Note that RuntimeException is the child class of Exception.
									</li>
									<li>Checked exceptions are error scenarios that require to be handled in the code,
										or else you will get compile time error. For example, if you use FileReader to
										read a file, it throws <code>FileNotFoundException</code> and we must catch it
										in the try-catch block or throw it again to the caller method. Unchecked
										exceptions are mostly caused by poor programming, for example,
										NullPointerException when invoking a method on an object reference without
										making sure that it’s not null. For example, I can write a method to remove all
										the vowels from the string. It’s the caller’s responsibility to make sure not to
										pass a null string. I might change the method to handle these scenarios but
										ideally, the caller should take care of this.</li>

							<summary>1) What is multitasking?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p style="text-align:justify;">A multitasking operating system is an operating system
									that gives you the perception of 2 or more tasks/jobs/processes running at the same
									time. It does this by dividing system resources amongst these tasks/jobs/processes
									and switching between the tasks/jobs/processes while they are executing over and
									over again. Usually, the CPU processes only one task at a time but the switching is
									so fast that it looks like the CPU is executing multiple processes at a time. They
									can support either preemptive multitasking, where the OS provides time to
									applications (virtually all modern OS), or cooperative multitasking, where the OS
									waits for the program to give back control (Windows 3.x, Mac OS 9, and earlier),
									leading to hangs and crashes. Also known as Timesharing, multitasking is a logical
									extension of multiprogramming.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">Multitasking programming is of two types which are as
									follows: <br>
								<ol>
									<li>Process-based Multitasking</li>

							<summary>8. What do you understand by context switching?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Context switching is a feature through which the current state of a thread is saved
									for it to be restored and executed later. Through context switching, multiple

							<summary>9. What is the function of the join() method?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The join() method causes the current thread to stop running until the thread due to
									congregate with completes its task. It is a commonly used function that facilitates
									the execution of multiple threads in an organized manner.</p>

							<summary>10. What is the function of the sleep() method?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>This is yet another popular Java Multithreading Interview Question. The sleep()
									method is used to pause a particular thread from executing and prioritizes another
									thread that needs to be executed before the current thread executes. </p>

						<details>
							<summary>11. What do you understand about Deadlock situations in Java Multithreading?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Deadlock is a situation where each thread is waiting for resources held by other
									waiting threads. Due to this situation, no threads are executed, causing a pause in
									program execution and breaking the code at runtime.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>12. How do you detect deadlock situations in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Deadlock situations can be detected by running the executable code on cmd and
									subsequently collecting the thread dump. If deadlock situations are present, the cmd
									will throw up a message.</p>

						<details>
							<summary>13. How can deadlock situations be avoided in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>This is one of the most common Java Multithreading interview questions asked in
									technical interviews. Deadlock situations in Java can be avoided by:

									By way of avoiding nested thread locks and providing locks to only one thread at a
									time

									By using thread join - the function helps to wait for threads to execute before
									other threads are executed, thereby preventing multiple threads from waiting for
									resources used by other threads.</p>

							<summary>15. How is thread-safety achieved in multithreaded programming?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Thready safety can be achieved if multiple threads can use a particular class

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>There are two types of threads in Java. They are,</p>
								<ol>
									<li>User Threads</li>
									<li>Daemon Threads</li>
								</ol>
								<p>User threads are threads which are created by the application or user. They are high
									priority threads. JVM will not exit until all user threads finish their execution.
									JVM wait for user threads to finish their task. These threads are foreground
									threads.</p>
								<p>Daemon threads are threads which are mostly&nbsp;created by the JVM. These threads
									always run in background. These threads are used to perform some background tasks
									like garbage collection. These threads are less priority threads. JVM will not wait
									for these threads to finish their execution. JVM will exit as soon as&nbsp;all user
									threads finish their execution.</p>

							<summary>18. Do two threads can have same name? If yes then how do you identify the threads
								having the same name?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, two threads can have same name. In such scenarios, Thread ID can be used to
									identify the threads. Thread ID is a unique long number which remains unchanged

							<summary>20. What do you mean by synchronization? Explain with an example?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Through synchronization, we can make the threads to execute particular method or
									block in sync not simultaneously. When a method or block is declared as
									synchronized, only one thread can enter into that method or block. When one thread
									is executing synchronized method or block, the other threads which wants to execute
									that method or block have to wait until first thread executes that method or block.
									Thus avoiding the thread interference and achieving the thread safeness.</p>

							<summary>21. What is object lock or monitor?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The synchronization in Java is built around an entity called object lock or monitor.
									Below is the brief description about lock or monitor.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Whenever an object is created to any class, an object lock is created and is
										stored inside the object.</li>
									<li>One object will have only one object lock associated with it.</li>
									<li>Any thread wants to enter into synchronized methods or blocks of any object,
										they must&nbsp;acquire object lock associated with that object and release the
										lock after they are done with the execution.</li>
									<li>The other threads which wants to enter into synchronized methods of that object
										have to wait until the currently executing thread releases the object lock.</li>
									<li>To enter into static synchronized methods or blocks, threads have to acquire
										class lock associated with that class as static members are stored inside the
										class memory.</li>

							<summary>22. I want only some part of the method to be synchronized, not the whole method?
								How do you achieve that?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>This can be done using synchronized blocks.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>23. What is the use of synchronized blocks?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Synchronization slows down the application. Because, at any given time, only one
									thread can enter into synchronized method. Other threads have to wait until first
									thread finishes it’s execution of that method. This slows down the execution of
									whole application.
								</p>
								<p>
									Instead of synchronizing the whole method, synchronizing the only that part which is
									to be monitored for thread safe saves the time. This can be done using synchronized
									blocks.</p>

									using either notify() or notifyAll() methods.
								</p>
								<p>
									notify() : This method wakes up one thread randomly that called wait() method on

							<summary>26. What is the difference between notify() and notifyAll() in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>notify() : When a thread calls notify() method on a particular object, only one
									thread will be notified which is waiting for the lock or monitor of that object. The
									thread chosen to notify is random i.e randomly one thread will be selected for
									notification. Notified thread doesn’t get the lock of the object immediately. It
									gets once the calling thread releases the lock of that object.
								</p>
								<p>
									notifyAll() : When a thread calls notifyAll() method on a particular object, all
									threads which are waiting for the lock of that object are notified. All notified
									threads will move from WAITING state to BLOCKED state. All these threads will
									get
									the lock of the object on a priority basis. The thread which gets the lock of

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>interrupt() method is used to interrupt sleeping or waiting thread. The whole thread
									interruption mechanism depends on&nbsp;an internal flag called&nbsp;interrupt
									status. The initial value of this flag for any thread is false. When you call
									interrupt() method on&nbsp;a thread, interrupt status of that thread will be set to

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>When you call start() method, a new thread is created and that newly created thread
									executes the task kept in the run() method. If you call run() method directly, no
									new thread is created. Any task kept in run() method is executed by the calling
									thread itself.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are calling run() method directly, then you are not making use of the
									multi-threaded programming concept. Because, when you call run() method directly, no
									new thread is created. run() method is executed by the calling thread itself. It
									just acts as normal method invocation. You are not using the concept of

									tasks.
								</p>
								<p>
									newCachedThreadPool: This method returns unbounded thread pool. If threads are not
									used for certain defined time (keepAliveTime), then it will kill extra threads.
								</p>
								<p>
									newSingleThreadedExecutor: This method returns an Executor with single thread.

							<summary>32. What is BlockingQueue</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>BlockingQueue is special type of queue which is used when producer threads produce
									object and consumer threads consume object.
								</p>
								<p>
									Producer thread keeps inserting objects in the queue unless it is full and once it
									is full, it will be blocked unless consumer threads start consuming.
								</p>
								<p>
									Similarly, consumer thread keep consuming objects until it is empty. Once it is
									empty, it will be blocked unless producer threads start producing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here are two important methods of BlockingQueue.
									put(): This method to put objects in queue until queue is full and waits for
									consumer thread to take object after that.
								</p>
								<p>
									take(): This method is used to take objects from the queue until it becomes empty.
									Once it is empty, it waits for producer threads to start producing the objects and
									put into the queue.</p>
