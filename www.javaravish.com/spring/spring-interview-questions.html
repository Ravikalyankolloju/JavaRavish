								1.What is Spring?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Spring is an open source development framework for enterprise Java. The core
									features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application,
									but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE
									platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and
									promote good programming practice by enabling a POJO-based programming model.
								</p>
							</div>

								2.What are benefits of using spring?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Following is the list of few of the great benefits of using Spring Framework:</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p><b>Lightweight</b> − Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and
											transparency. The basic version of spring framework is around 2MB.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Inversion of control (IOC)</b> − Loose coupling is achieved in spring
											using the technique Inversion of Control. The objects give their
											dependencies instead of creating or looking for dependent objects.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Aspect oriented (AOP)</b> − Spring supports Aspect oriented
											programming and enables cohesive development by separating application
											business logic from system services.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Container</b> − Spring contains and manages the life cycle and
											configuration of application objects.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>MVC Framework</b> − Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC
											framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as
											Struts or other over engineered or less popular web frameworks.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Transaction Management</b> − Spring provides a consistent transaction
											management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a
											single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using
											JTA, for example).</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Exception Handling</b> − Spring provides a convenient API to translate
											technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for
											example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>

								3.What are the different modules in Spring framework?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Following are the modules of the Spring framework:</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>Core module</li>
									<li>Bean module</li>
									<li>Context module</li>
									<li>Expression Language module</li>
									<li>JDBC module</li>
									<li>ORM module</li>
									<li>OXM module</li>
									<li>Java Messaging Service(JMS) module</li>
									<li>Transaction module</li>

									<li>Web-Struts module</li>
									<li>Web-Portlet module</li>

								4.What is Spring configuration file?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Spring configuration file is an XML file. This file contains the classes
									information and describes how these classes are configured and introduced to
									each other.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>
								5.What is Dependency Injection?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Inversion of Control (IoC) is a general concept, and it can be expressed in many
									different ways and Dependency Injection is merely one concrete example of
									Inversion of Control.</p>
								<p>This concept says that you do not create your objects but describe how they
									should be created. You don't directly connect your components and services
									together in code but describe which services are needed by which components in a
									configuration file. A container (the IOC container) is then responsible for
									hooking it all up.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>
								6.What are the different types of IoC (dependency injection)?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Types of IoC are −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p><b>Constructor-based dependency injection</b> − Constructor-based DI is
											accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a
											number of arguments, each representing a dependency on other class.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Setter-based dependency injection</b> − Setter-based DI is
											accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after
											invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method
											to instantiate your bean.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>
								Which DI would you suggest Constructor-based or setter-based DI?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Since you can mix both, Constructor- and Setter-based DI, it is a good rule of
									thumb to use constructor arguments for mandatory dependencies and setters for
									optional dependencies. Note that the use of a <i>@Required</i> annotation on a
									setter can be used to make setters required dependencies.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>
								What are the benefits of IOC?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The main benefits of IOC or dependency injection are −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p>It minimizes the amount of code in your application.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>It makes your application easy to test as it doesn't require any
											singletons or JNDI lookup mechanisms in your unit test cases.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Loose coupling is promoted with minimal effort and least intrusive
											mechanism.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>IOC containers support eager instantiation and lazy loading of services.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>

							<summary>
								What is AOP?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Aspect-oriented programming, or AOP, is a programming technique that allows
									programmers to modularize crosscutting concerns, or behavior that cuts across
									the typical divisions of responsibility, such as logging and transaction
									management. The core construct of AOP is the aspect, which encapsulates
									behaviors affecting multiple classes into reusable modules.</p>

								What is Spring IoC container?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The Spring IoC creates the objects, wire them together, configure them, and

							<summary>
								What are types of IoC containers? Explain them.
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>There are two types of IoC containers −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p><b>Bean Factory container</b> − This is the simplest container providing
											basic support for DI .The BeanFactory is usually preferred where the
											resources are limited like mobile devices or applet based applications
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Spring ApplicationContext Container</b> − This container adds more
											enterprise-specific functionality such as the ability to resolve textual
											messages from a properties file and the ability to publish application
											events to interested event listeners.</p>

								What are the common implementations of the ApplicationContext?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The three commonly used implementation of 'Application Context' are −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p><b>FileSystemXmlApplicationContext</b> − This container loads the
											definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you need to provide the
											full path of the XML bean configuration file to the constructor.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</b> − This container loads the
											definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you do not need to

											properly because this container will look bean configuration XML file in
											CLASSPATH.</p>

									<li>
										<p>Application contexts provide a generic way to load file resources, such
											as images.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Application contexts can publish events to beans that are registered as
											listeners.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Certain operations on the container or beans in the container, which have
											to be handled in a programmatic fashion with a bean factory, can be
											handled declaratively in an application context.</p>
									</li>
									<li>

									<li>
										<p><b>Instantiate</b> − First the spring container finds the bean's

									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Populate properties</b> − Using the dependency injection, spring
											populates all of the properties as specified in the bean definition.</p>

										<p><b>Set Bean Name</b> − If the bean implements BeanNameAware interface,
											spring passes the bean's id to setBeanName() method.</p>

									<li>
										<p><b>Set Bean factory</b> − If Bean implements BeanFactoryAware interface,
											spring passes the beanfactory to setBeanFactory() method.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Pre Initialization</b> − Also called postprocess of bean. If there are
											any bean BeanPostProcessors associated with the bean, Spring calls
											postProcesserBeforeInitialization() method.</p>

									<li>
										<p><b>Initialize beans</b> − If the bean implements IntializingBean,its
											afterPropertySet() method is called. If the bean has init method
											declaration, the specified initialization method is called.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Post Initialization</b> − If there are any BeanPostProcessors
											associated with the bean, their postProcessAfterInitialization() methods

									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Ready to use</b> − Now the bean is ready to use by the application.

								What is bean auto wiring?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The Spring container is able to autowire relationships between collaborating
									beans. This means that it is possible to automatically let Spring resolve
									collaborators (other beans) for your bean by inspecting the contents of the

							<summary>
								What are different Modes of auto wiring?

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The autowiring functionality has five modes which can be used to instruct Spring
									container to use autowiring for dependency injection −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p><b>no</b> − This is default setting which means no autowiring and you
											should use explicit bean reference for wiring. You have nothing to do
											special for this wiring. This is what you already have seen in
											Dependency Injection chapter.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>byName</b> − Autowiring by property name. Spring container looks at
											the properties of the beans on which autowire attribute is set to byName
											in the XML configuration file. It then tries to match and wire its
											properties with the beans defined by the same names in the configuration
											file.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>byType</b> − Autowiring by property datatype. Spring container looks
											at the properties of the beans on which autowire attribute is set to
											byType in the XML configuration file. It then tries to match and wire a
											property if its type matches with exactly one of the beans name in
											configuration file. If more than one such beans exist, a fatal exception
											is thrown.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>constructor</b> − Similar to byType, but type applies to constructor
											arguments. If there is not exactly one bean of the constructor argument
											type in the container, a fatal error is raised.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>autodetect</b> − Spring first tries to wire using autowire by
											constructor, if it does not work, Spring tries to autowire by byType.

											override autowiring.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><b>Primitive data types</b> − You cannot autowire so-called simple
											properties such as primitives, Strings, and Classes.</p>

								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p>Spring's MVC is very versatile and flexible based on interfaces but
											Struts forces Actions and Form object into concrete inheritance.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Spring provides both interceptors and controllers, thus helps to factor
											out common behavior to the handling of many requests.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Spring can be configured with different view technologies like
											Freemarker, JSP, Tiles, Velocity, XLST etc. and also you can create your
											own custom view mechanism by implementing Spring View interface.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>In Spring MVC Controllers can be configured using DI (IOC) that makes its
											testing and integration easy.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Web tier of Spring MVC is easy to test than Struts web tier, because of
											the avoidance of forced concrete inheritance and explicit dependence of
											controllers on the dispatcher servlet.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Struts force your Controllers to extend a Struts class but Spring
											doesn't, there are many convenience Controller implementations that you
											can choose to extend.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>In Struts, Actions are coupled to the view by defining ActionForwards
											within a ActionMapping or globally. SpringMVC has HandlerMapping
											interface to support this functionality.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>With Struts, validation is usually performed (implemented) in the
											validate method of an ActionForm. In SpringMVC, validators are business
											objects that are NOT dependent on the Servlet API which makes these
											validators to be reused in your business logic before persisting a
											domain object to a database.</p>
