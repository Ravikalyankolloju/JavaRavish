						<br>
						<details>
							<summary>1. What is inheritance in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Acquiring the features from existing entities is known as “inheritance”.<br> The
									existing entity is called a super or parent class and the new entity that is
									acquiring the
									features of an existing entity is called sub-class or child class. <br>The process
									of
									inheriting the properties and behaviors from one object to another object is known
									as java. <br>Creating a new class from an existing class using an IS-A relationship
									is
									known as “inheritance”.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>2. What is the purpose of inheritance?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Inheritance offers code reusability and thereby Rapid Application Development (RAD)
									is possible.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>3. What are the types of inheritance?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The following are the types of inheritances:<br>
									a. Single inheritance<br>
									b. Multi-level inheritance<br>
									c. Hierarchical inheritance<br>
									d. Multiple inheritance<br>
									e. Hybrid inheritance</p>

								<u>Single inheritance:</u> If a class is having only one parent class that is known as
								“single inheritance”.<br>
								<u>Multi-level inheritance:</u><br>
								<u>Hierarchical inheritance:</u>In this inheritance, one class is being extended to more
								than one class.<br>
								<u>Multiple Inheritance:</u> In multilevel inheritance, one class is extended by one
								class. That extended class or the subclass is being extended by another class and forms
								a chain of relationships between the classes multilevel inheritance.<br>
								<u>Hybrid inheritance:</u>A hybrid inheritance in java is a combination of single and
								multiple inheritance. It can be achieved through interfaces.<br></p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>4. What is the purpose of the ‘super’ keyword in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p> The following are the major uses of super keyword they are:
								<ul>
									<li>If your method overrides one of its super class’s methods, you can invoke the
										overridden method through the use of the keyword super.</li>

									<li>Using a super keyword we can explicitly call the immediate superclass
										constructor
										from the subclass constructor.</li>

									<li>From sub-class, to access instance variables of superclass where a subclass is
										also
										having a variable with the same name.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>5. What are the differences between ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Using ‘this’ from within one class constructor, a call can be made to another
									constructor of the same class.<br> Whereas, using ‘super’ keyword superclass
									constructor
									is called from sub-class constructor.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>6. I don’t want my class to be inherited by any other class. What should I do?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>You should declare your class as final. But you can’t define your class as final if
									it is an abstract class. A class declared as final can’t be extended by any other
									class.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>7. What is Is-A relationship in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Is-A relationship represents Inheritance. It is implemented using the “extends”
									keyword. It is used for code reusability.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>8. Can we assign superclass to subclass?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>9. Can a class extend more than one class?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, one class can extend only a single class.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>10. Are constructor and instance initialization block inherited to subclass?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, constructor and instance initialization block of the superclass cannot be
									inherited to its subclass but they are executed while creating an object of the
									subclass.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>11. Are static members inherited to subclass in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Static block cannot be inherited to its subclass.

									A static method of superclass is inherited to the subclass as a static member and
									non-static method is inherited as a non-static member only.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>12. Can we extend (inherit) final class?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, a class declared with final keyword cannot be inherited.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>13. Can a final method and private members overridden?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>14. What is order of calling constructors in case of inheritance?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>In case of inheritance, constructors are called from the top to down hierarchy.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>15. What are the advantages of inheritance in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The advantages of inheritance in java are as follows:
								<ul>
									<li>We can minimize the length of duplicate code in an application by putting the
										common code in the superclass and sharing it amongst several subclasses.</li>
									<li>Due to reducing the length of code, the redundancy of the application is also
										reduced.</li>
									<li>Inheritance can also make application code more flexible to change.</li>
								</ul>

								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>16. Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java through class?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Multiple inheritance means that one class extends two superclasses or base classes
									but in Java, one class cannot extend more than one class simultaneously. At most,
									one class can extend only one class.
									<br>
									Therefore, to reduce ambiguity, complexity, and confusion, Java does not support
									multiple inheritance through classes.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>17. How will you restrict a member of a class from inheriting its subclass?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>We can restrict members of a class by declaring them private because the private
									members of superclass are not available to the subclass directly. They are only
									available in their own class.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>18. Can we access subclass members if we create an object of superclass?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, we can access only superclass members but not the subclass members.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>19. Can we access both superclass and subclass members if we create an object of
								subclass?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, we can access both superclass and subclass members.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>20. What happens if both superclass and subclass have a field with the same name?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Only subclass members are accessible if an object of subclass is instantiated.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>21. What is the diamond problem in inheritance? How can it be resolved in Java?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The diamond problem is a situation that arises in multiple inheritance when a
									subclass inherits from two classes that have a common parent class. This creates a
									diamond-shaped inheritance hierarchy, and if the common parent class has a method
									that is overridden in both subclasses, it becomes ambiguous which implementation
									should be used. In Java, this problem is resolved by using the "default" method
									feature introduced in Java 8. A default method is a method declared in an interface
									with a default implementation that can be overridden in the implementing class.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>23. What is the difference between composition and inheritance?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p> Java supports both composition and inheritance, but both are different in many ways.
									Composition objects have a reference to the composition classes by having a loosely
									bounded relationship, and it has a – has a relationship between classes. Using this,
									we can use single classes that can be composed within multiple classes and used in
									dependency injection and composition is a relationship between objects, whereas
									Inheritance is a relationship between the classes and it has is a relationship
									between the classes and using inheritance derived class object carries the base
									class definition hence it is a tightly bounded relationship. It is mostly used in
									run time polymorphism, and in this, a single class can only inherit only one class.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>24. What is the difference between "is-a" and "has-a" relationship?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>"Is-a" relationship is a type of inheritance relationship where a subclass is a
									specialized version of its superclass. For example, a "Cat" class can inherit from
									an "Animal" class as it is a specialized type of animal. On the other hand, "has-a"
									relationship is a type of composition relationship where a class has an instance of
									another class as one of its members. For example, a "Car" class may have an instance
									of a "Wheel" class.</p>

						<h1><b>2. Method Overloading and Overriding Interview Questions</b></h1>
						<br>

						<details>
							<summary>1. What is method overloading in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>If two or more methods have same name, but different argument then it is called
									method overloading.<br>
									Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one
									method with the same name, as long as the methods have different parameter lists.
									This can be a useful way of providing different behavior for a method depending on
									the context in which it is called.</p>

						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>3. Can we change only return type while method overloading?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>You can not.If we change only return type, it will become ambiguous for compiler to
									figure out which method to call.That is why you can not change only return type.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>4. Can we overload static and main method in java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, we can overload static methods in java but we can not override them.<br>
									you can overload main method in java but only method with signature public static
									void main(String[] args) will be used when your class is invoked by JVM.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>5. Can overloaded method be overrided?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, we can override a method which is overloaded in super class.</p>

						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>6. Can we declare one overloaded method as static and another one as non-static?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes. Overloaded methods can be either static or non static.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>7. How do compiler differentiate overloaded methods from duplicate methods?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Compiler uses method signature to check whether the method is overloaded or
									duplicated. Duplicate methods will have same method signatures i.e same name, same
									number of arguments and same types of arguments. Overloaded methods will also have
									same name but differ in number of arguments or else types of arguments.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>8. What is method overriding in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Method overriding is another way to define a method with same name but different code
									but it must be in subclass. Overriding is based upon run-time Polymorphism as method
									calls are resolved at run-time depending upon actual object.
									<br>
									For example if a variable of type Parent holds an object of Child class then method
									invoked will be from child class and not parent class, provides its overridden.
									<br>
									In order to override a method, you must follow rules of method overriding which
									means declaring method with same signature in sub class. See here to learn more
									about method overriding in Java.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>9. Can we override static method in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, you cannot override static method in Java because they are resolved and bonded
									during compile time. Since overriding is a run-time activity and if a method call is
									already resolved at compile time then it will not take place and that's why it's not
									possible to override static method in Java.
									<br>
									But, you can define another static method of same signature in sub class, this is
									known as method hiding. Actual method called will depends upon the type of class and
									not on type of object as its the case with overriding. See here to learn more about
									why you cannot override static method in Java.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>10. Can we override a private method in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, you cannot override private method in Java. Since private methods are not visible
									outside the class, they are not available in sub-class hence they cannot be
									overridden.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>11. What is covariant method overriding?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>One of the rule of method overriding is that return type of overriding method must be
									same as overridden method but this restriction is relaxed little bit from Java 1.5
									and now overridden method can return sub class of return type of original method.
									<br>
									This relaxation is known as co-variant method overriding and it allows you to remove
									casting at client end.

						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>14. Can we change return type of method in subclass while overriding?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, you cannot change the return type of method during overriding. It would be
									violation of rules of overriding. Though from Java 5 onward you can replace the
									return type with sub type e.g. if original method has return type as
									java.lang.Object then you can change return type of overridden method as any type
									e.g. clone() method.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>15. Can we override a method which throws run-time exception without throws clause?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, you can. There is no restriction on throwing RuntimeException from overriding
									method. So if your original method throws NullPointerException than its not
									necessary to throw NPE from overriding method as well.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>16. How do you call super class version of an overriding method in sub class?
							</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>You can call it using super keyword. For example if you have a method calculate() in
									both parent and child class then from child class you can invoke parent class method
									calculate() as super.calculate().</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>17. Can we override a non-static method as static in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, its not possible to define a non-static method of same name as static method in

									overriding static method in Java.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>18. Can we override the constructor in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, you cannot override constructors in Java because they are not inherited.
									Remember, we are talking about overriding here not overloading, you can overload
									construct but you cannot override them.<br>
									Overriding always happens in child class and since constructors are not inherited
									and their name is always the same as the class name it's not possible to override
									them in Java.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary>19. Can we override a final method in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>No, you cannot override a final method in Java. Trying to override a final method in
									a subclass will result in a compile-time error. Actually making a method final is
									signal to all developer that this method is not for inheritance and it should be
									used in its present form. You generally make a method final due to security reasons.

							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> How finally used under Exception Handling?</summary>

							<summary> What is Encapsulation?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>It is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access

									class. Therefore encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is the primary benefit of Encapsulation?</summary>

						<b>1. Multithreading, Concurrency and Thread basics Questions</b>
						</br><br>

						<details>
							<summary>1) Can we make array volatile in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Yes, you can make an array volatile in Java but only the
									reference which is pointing to an array, not the whole array. What I mean, if one
									thread changes the reference variable to points to another array, that will provide
									a volatile guarantee, but if multiple threads are changing individual array elements
									they won't be having happens before guarantee provided by the volatile modifier.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>2) Can volatile make a non-atomic operation to atomic?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>This another good question I love to ask on volatile, mostly as a follow-up of the
									previous question. This question is also not easy to answer because volatile is not
									about atomicity, but there are cases where you can use a volatile variable to make
									the operation atomic.
									<br>
									One example I have seen is having a long field in your class. If you know that a
									long field is accessed by more than one thread e.g. a counter, a price field or
									anything, you better make it volatile. Why? because reading to a long variable is
									not atomic in Java and done in two steps, If one thread is writing or updating long
									value, it's possible for another thread to see half value (fist 32-bit). While
									reading/writing a volatile long or double (64 bit) is atomic.<br>
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>3) What are practical uses of volatile modifier?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>One of the practical use of the volatile variable is to make reading double and long
									atomic. Both double and long are 64-bit wide and they are read in two parts, first
									32-bit first time and next 32-bit second time, which is non-atomic but volatile
									double and long read is atomic in Java. Another use of the volatile variable is to
									provide a memory barrier, just like it is used in <span
										style="font-family: inherit;">Disrupter </span>framework. Basically, Java Memory
									model inserts a write barrier after you write to a volatile variable and a read
									barrier before you read it. Which means, if you write to volatile field then it's
									guaranteed that any thread accessing that variable will see the value you wrote and
									anything you did before doing that right into the thread is guaranteed to have
									happened and any updated data values will also be visible to all threads, because
									the memory barrier flushed all other writes to the cache.<br>
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>4) What guarantee volatile variable provides?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>volatile variables provide the guarantee about ordering and visibility e.g. volatile
									assignment cannot be re-ordered with other statements but in the absence of any
									synchronization instruction compiler, JVM or JIT are free to reorder statements for
									better performance. volatile also provides the happens-before guarantee which
									ensures changes made in one thread is visible to others. In some cases volatile also
									provide atomicity e.g. reading 64-bit data types like long and double are not atomic
									but read of volatile double or long is atomic.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>

						<details>
							<summary>5) Which one would be easy to write? synchronization code for 10 threads or 2
								threads?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>In terms of writing code, both will be of same complexity because synchronization
									code is independent of a number of threads. Choice of synchronization though depends
									upon a number of threads because the number of thread present more contention, so
									you go for advanced synchronization technique e.g. lock stripping, which requires
									more complex code and expertise
