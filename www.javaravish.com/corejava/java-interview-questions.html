									instructions that must be interpreted into instructions that can be sent
									directly to the processor.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> Why Java is considered dynamic?</summary>

						<details>
							<summary> What do you mean by Constructor?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class has a

						<details>
							<summary> What do you mean by Checked Exceptions?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>It is an exception that is typically a user error or a problem that cannot be

									cannot be found, an exception occurs. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored
									at the time of compilation.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> Explain Runtime Exceptions?</summary>

									signature.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> When throw keyword is used?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">

									you just caught, by using throw keyword.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> How finally used under Exception Handling?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The finally keyword is used to create a block of code that follows a try block. A
									finally block of code always executes, whether or not an exception has occurred.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What things should be kept in mind while creating your own exceptions in
								Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>While creating your own exception −</p>
								<ul class="list">
									<li>
										<p>All exceptions must be a child of Throwable.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>If you want to write a checked exception that is automatically enforced
											by the Handle or Declare Rule, you need to extend the Exception class.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>You want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the
											RuntimeException class.</p>

									hidden field.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is Polymorphism?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common

									to a child class object.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is Abstraction?</summary>

									simply method declarations without a body.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> When Abstract methods are used?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual
									implementation of that method to be determined by child classes, you can declare
									the method in the parent class as abstract.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is Encapsulation?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>It is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access
									to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be
									accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the
									class. Therefore encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is the primary benefit of Encapsulation?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code
									without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this Encapsulation
									gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.</p>
							</div>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary> What is an Interface?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
